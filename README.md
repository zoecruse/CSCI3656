This contains all of my files for the final project in Numerical Computation, May 2024, CU Boulder
The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms of the malaria parasite. 
All HVR files as well as the metadata for this were obtained from the Colorado Index of Complex Networks by Dr. Dan Larremore.
